<p align="center">
A simple message scheduling tool for WhatsApp private chats or groups. Built to make sure your messages are seen at the right time.
</p>

## Why We Built This
In our group, important messages often vanished into the noise — sent at odd hours, buried under a flood of chats, and seen too late (or not at all). We built this tool to change that. With manual scheduling, you control exactly when your message hits.

## Features
- Schedule messages for private chats or groups
- Set exact send times
- Retry send

## Getting Started

### Locally (Docker)

1. Run the following commands:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ghazlabs/wa-scheduler.git

    make run
    ```

2. Open <http://localhost:9865> to access the dashboard
3. Log in with username `admin` and password `admin`
4. Scan the QR code to connect your WhatsApp account
5. When the dashboard shows, you already can schedule message
